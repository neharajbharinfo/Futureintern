## 🎨 Task 1: Image Generation with Stable Diffusion
### 🔹 Objective
Utilized **Stable Diffusion** to generate images based on text prompts, enabling AI-driven creative visual synthesis.

### 🔹 Implementation
- Installed necessary dependencies (Transformers, Diffusers, Torch, etc.)
- Loaded the **Stable Diffusion v1-4** model
- Processed a text prompt (e.g., *"A futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars and neon lights."*)
- Generated and saved high-quality images

### 🔹 Example Command:
```sh
python generate_image.py --prompt "A cyberpunk city at midnight with neon lights."
```

---

## 🔄 Task 2: Extracting and Processing Files
### 🔹 Objective
Extracted and organized compressed files containing code and assets.

### 🔹 Implementation
- Handled `.zip` file extraction
- Separated code, assets, and dependencies
- Ensured proper file structure for easy navigation and deployment

### 🔹 Tools Used
- Python (for automated extraction and file handling)
- Manual file organization for project clarity

---

## 📂 Task 3: Structuring a GitHub Repository with a README
### 🔹 Objective
Created a structured **GitHub repository** with a **detailed README** file for clear documentation.

### 🔹 Implementation
- Wrote a well-structured **README.md** file including:
  - Introduction 📌
  - Prerequisites 🛠️
  - Installation & Setup 🏗️
  - Usage Instructions 🎯
  - Contributing Guidelines 🤝
  - License Information ⚖️
  - Acknowledgements 🎖️
- Added **GitHub repository links** for easy access
