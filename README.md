# ✨ Text Generation with GPT-2  

## 📝 Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use **GPT-2**, a powerful text generation model by OpenAI, to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to mimic the style and structure of the training data.  

## 🌟 Features  
- 🔥 Generate text using GPT-2  
- 🎯 Fine-tune the model on your own dataset  
- 📊 Create AI-generated text that aligns with specific writing styles  

## 🔧 Requirements  
- 🐖 Python 3.6+  
- 🤖 Transformers library  
- 🔬 PyTorch or TensorFlow  

## 👆 Installation  

1️⃣ Clone the repository:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/neharajbharinfo/gpt2-text-generation.git  
cd gpt2-text-generation  
```

2️⃣ Install the required packages:  

```bash  
pip install transformers torch  # or tensorflow if you prefer TensorFlow  
```

## 🚀 Usage  

1️⃣ Prepare your dataset as a plain text file.  

2️⃣ Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset.  

3️⃣ Use the fine-tuned model to generate text based on a prompt.
