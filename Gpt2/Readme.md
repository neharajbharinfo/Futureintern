# 🚀 Generate Text using GPT-2

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **GPT-2**, a powerful transformer model by OpenAI, to generate text based on a given prompt. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to create meaningful and structured text outputs.

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
```

## 📜 How to Run
1️⃣ Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Generate_text_using_GPT2.ipynb
```

2️⃣ Run each cell sequentially to:
   - Load the GPT-2 model
   - Fine-tune the model on a dataset
   - Generate text based on a prompt

## 🛠️ Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
```

## 🎯 Expected Output
After running the notebook, the model will generate text based on the input prompt. Example:

```text
Input: "Once upon a time in a faraway land"
Output: "Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a kingdom full of mysteries and magic..."
```
